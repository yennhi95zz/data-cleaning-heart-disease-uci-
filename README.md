## Dataset
We will be using the [Heart Disease UCI](https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kaggle.com%2Fdatasets%2Fcherngs%2Fheart-disease-cleveland-uci) dataset from Kaggle as an example to illustrate the techniques and methods for cleaning data. The dataset contains information about patients and whether they have heart disease or not.

## Techniques and Methods
The guide covers the following techniques and methods for cleaning data:

1. Dealing with Missing Data: 

2. Dealing with Duplicates: 

3. Outlier Detection: 

4. Encode Categorical Features: 

5. Transformation: 

6. Building a Machine Learning Model

7. Evaluation
